Secure
======

Overview
========

Secure uses 256-bit AES encryption to stop other people looking at your 
files. Unlike programs such as Truecrypt and FreeOTFE which work by 
installing a driver on the system and thus require a driver Toucan 
encrypts on the file level. The main difference is that you need to 
encrypt files after you create them with Toucan whereas using Truecrypt 
files are automatically encrypted when you save them. 

User Interface
==============

The layout of the Secure tab is very similar to that of the Backup tab. 
Along the top are the controls for the backup, the standard jobs area, 
the standard rules area and the choice for encryption or decryption. On 
the left hand side below these settings if the computer browser. Here 
you can select which files to encrypt/decrypt. On the right hand side is 
the file list. Once you have added files from the computer browser they 
appear here so you can easily see what will be backed up. Using the 
buttons on the right hand side you can also add Variables and expand all 
of thefolders you have selected. The file list is automatically coloured 
using any Rules you might have selected.

Preview
=======

Whenever you add new items to a secure job they will automatically be 
previewed and so either be left black, so show they will be included in the 
job, or red to show that they have been excluded.
