comprehensive list is given below.

	Hides the startup slpash screen

.. cmdoption:: -u, --unittests

	Changes the location that Toucan saves its settings. Variables can be
	used and will be expanded

.. cmdoption:: -s<script>, --script=<script>

	Runs the given script as if it were in the input area of the Script tab 
	in the user interface. Output will be sent to the command line . Please
