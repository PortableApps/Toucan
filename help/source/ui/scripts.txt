Overview
========

A Script is used to tie a number of Jobs together and to provide a way 
to extend the built-in functionality of Toucan. Behind the scenes Toucan 
has an interpreter for the Lua programming language. It is a standard 
interpreter with a number of extra Toucan functions added and as such 
should accept and existing Lua scripts. 

User Interface
==============

The Script interface is very similar to the Variables interface. Scripts 
can be saved, added and removed using the standard controls in the top 
left of the window. To run a script simply press the Run button. The 
rest of the window is taken up by a large syntax highlighted text editor 
from creating scripts.

Lua Types
=========

strings
-------

In Lua strings can be written in quotes, such as ``"this is a string"`` or 
in double brackets, such as ``[[this is also a string]]``. In Toucan it is 
preferable to use the form surrounded by square brackets. This is 
because when in quotes a \\ is treated as an escape character and thus 
does not work as expected when writing Windows file paths. One solution 
is to just use a / instead, which is fully supported by Toucan or to use 
the square bracket form. 

tables
------

When Toucan needs a list of strings it uses a table, for example when 
passing a list of paths to be encrypted. The same conditions about 
strings apply when they are in tables, an example of the preferred 
format is ``{[[C:\\path\\one]], [[@drive@\\path\\two]], 
[[D:\\path\\@date@]]}`` unlike some Lua tables we do not specify an index 
for each value, they have no use to Toucan and as such just clutter the 
function calls. 

Toucan also uses tables when specifying options for Sync and Backup. An 
example Sync map would be ``{size = false, short = true}``. This is 
technically an associative map. You do not need to set all of the 
attributes when specifying these options and any that you do not will 
take the default values shown on the functions documentation.
