Command Line
============

All command line options in Toucan have a long and a short form.
A comprehensive list is given below.

.. cmdoption:: /v, --verbose

	Enable verbose logging.

.. cmdoption:: /d <path>, --data=<path>

	Changes the location of the Data folder where Toucan saves its settings.
	Variables can be used and will be expanded.

.. cmdoption:: /s <script>, --script=<script>

	Runs the given script as if it were in the input area of the Script tab
	in the user interface. Output will be sent to the command line . Please
	note that the script command line parameter takes the same input as the
	input area in the user interface. This means that if you wish to run a
	specific existing script you will need to use.
	``--script="dofile(getscript([[myscriptname]]))"``

.. cmdoption:: /l <path>, --log=<path>

	Produces a log file in the specified location, it can be used both on
	the command line and in the user interface.
