# Toucan
Toucan is a custom built portable app for advanced users to synchronise, backup and encrypt their data, wherever they are.

You can find more information at the app's official page at Portableapps.com: http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/toucan

Please note that the application is not being actively developed and is in a "sustaining" mode. That means that new features
are unlikely to appear, but bug submissions will generally be reviewed and fixed if possible.
