<h3>Drag and Drop</h3>
All parts of Toucan that require a file path, or files / folders to be added to them support drag and drop. For example you can drag a folder straight from Window Explorer into one of the Sync areas to add it. Dragging multiple files / folders is supported in the  Backup and Secure file lists.
<h3>Right-click Exclusions</h3>
When you have a set of rules selected you can right click on files in the file lists to exlcude them quickly, either by name or extension. This is supported in Sync, Backup and Secure. Note for this to work a set of rules must be selected or the menu will not be shown. New rules will be added to the selected set of rules.
