<H2>Translating Toucan</H2>
If you do not have an existing translation then follow these steps:<p>

<ol><li>Download a copy of <a href="htpp://www.poedit.net">Poedit</a>. This is the program you will use to translate Toucan.</li>
<li>Go to http://drop.io/toucanlang and download the default.pot file</li>
<li>Open Poedit and click File->New catalog from POT File and fill in your details, if you do not provide an email address I will not be able to ask for updates and your translation is unlikely to be included in Toucan. Save it as toucan.po</li>
<li>Translate the strings and when you close Toucan a file called toucan.mo will be created</li>
<li>Copy toucan.po and toucan.mo to a folder called <em>your language code</em> and copy a lang.ini file from another language and update it</li>
<li>Put the it under ToucanApptoucanlang and you will be able to use your translation</li>
</ol><p>


If you already have a translation:<p>

<ol><li>Go to http://drop.io/toucanlang and download the default.pot file</li>
<li>Open your .po file and click Catalog->Update from POT file and choose the default.pot</li>
<li>Update the translations as necessary</li>
</ol><p>

If you have create a new translation or updated an existing one if you could zip the files and upload them to http://drop.io/toucanlang site I would be most grateful and they will be included in the next release.
