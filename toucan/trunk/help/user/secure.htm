Jobs can also be used on the <A HREF="command-secure.htm">command line</A> as well as in the user interface. Jobs allow you to save you data and reload it when you next run Toucan.

OK runs Secure with the currently entered information. Preview will change the colours of the items that you had added to the file list. If an item remains black then it will be encrypted/decrypted. If the item is changed to red then it will not be encrypted/decypted. Previewing does not effect the files in any way.
<H3>Rules</H3>

You can use this drop-down box to select any rules that apply when Secure runs. To check they are working as you require it is recommended that you preview them first.
<H3>File Browser</H3>
<IMG SRC="screenshots/general-computer.png" BORDER="0"><P>
The file browser allows you to add files to the file list or to remove them. Double clicking on drives or folders expands them or collapses them. Both files and folders can be added to the file list.
<H3>File List</H3>
<IMG SRC="screenshots/secure-files.png" BORDER="0"><P>
Any files or folders that you add from the browser will appear on this list. When previewing the file names will change, see Action buttons for more information. The upper most button shows the <A HREF="insertvariable.htm">Insert Variable Dialog</A>. The lower button expands all of the folders in the file list so you can quickly see all of the files that you have added.
