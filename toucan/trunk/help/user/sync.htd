<H2>Sync</H2>
Sync can be used to keep your files up to date, or just to copy them around.
<H3>Jobs</H3>
<IMG SRC="screenshots/general-jobs.png" BORDER="0"><P>
You can use the drop-down box and buttons to create new Backup jobs, save your current data as a job and remove existing ones. Existing jobs will appear in th drop-down box. Jobs can also be used on the <A HREF="command-backup.htm">command line</A> as well as in the user interface. Jobs allow you to save you data and reload it when you next run Toucan.
<H3>Function</H3>
<IMG SRC="screenshots/sync-function.png" BORDER="0"><P>
<UL>
<LI>Copy - This copies all of the files in the source directory to the destination directory</LI>
<LI>Update - This copies all of the files in the source directory that are newer than those in the destination directory, it uses the modified time of the files.</LI> 
<LI>Mirror - Mirror creates an exact copy of the source directory in the destination directory, it may delete files in the destination directory.</LI>
<LI>Equalise - This ensures that both direcories have the newest possible files</LI>
<LI>Move - All of the files in the source directory are moved into the destination directory</LI>
<LI>Clean - Any files / folders in the destination directory that are not in the source directory are removed. This is effectively half of a mirror operation</LI>
</UL><p>
All of the functions use file streams to minimise the amount of copying that they have to do. However if you have a device with very slow reads then it may be preferable to disable this. To do this you need to open the Settings.ini file located in the Data subfolder of your Toucan installation and change the line that says <code>DisableStream=0</code> to <code>DisableStream=1</code>
<H3>Other</H3>
