<H2>Backup All Documents</H2>
If you have multiple user accounts on one machine then backing up all of their documents is easy with Toucan, you need the following set of Rules:<p>
<strong>Folders to exclude:</strong>
<pre>\\Users (or \\Documents and Settings if you use XP or below)</pre><P>
<strong>Locations to Include</strong>
<pre>\\Documents (or \\My Documents if you use XP or below)</pre><p>
<P>
Simply save this into a set of rules and then use it with a job that has the Users or Documents and Settings directory in it and only the documents will be backed up.
</PRE>
